Verilog Project using an FPGA board with a VGA display.

This game was created for Nostalgic gamers to play the game with more erratic ghost movement that followed PacMan as opposed to more random movement.

We are dynamically storing PacMan's position and the ghosts are not randomly moving but instead moving towards PacMan. 

This game was created on the Xilinx ISE.
